## Props




What is props short for?
"Pops" is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for **passing data from one component to another**
Data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow (one way from parent to child), props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
