## REST API

Who is Roy Fielding?

**He helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. He explained why the web works the way it does.**

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?


What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

**HTTP tells the browser what protocol to use. It is capable of describing the location of something in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. Like GPS coordinates. HTTP is ALL about applying verbs to nouns**

EX. when you go back to a webpage, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL your typed in and back comes a webpage.


The whole world wide web is built on an architechtural style called "REST". Rest provides a definiton of a resource, which is what those things point. A webpage is a representaion of a resource. The URL tells the browser there is a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept.
